# Usage of Rust native library in Haxe

## Meaning of the repository
    This is just my experiment aimed at studying the execution of code from a native library generated by Rust

## How to run it?
    First of all, you need to install Rust and Haxe. Then go to rustSrc and run `cargo build` in it. 
    Then go back and compile Haxe code by using `haxe build.hxml`.
    And the last: go to the `rustSrc\target\debug` and copy `rustSrc.dll` from it to `bin\cpp`, then you can run Main.exe
